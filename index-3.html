  <p><i>Cheshire Cat</i> was blink-182's debut studio album. It was recorded at Westbeach Recorders. It was released by the record label <i>Cargo Music</i>. This album was named after the famous character from <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, which was DeLonge's favorite character. By 2001, the album had sold over 250,000 copies. The release of the album was considered by many to be a highly iconic release. However, at the time of release, blink-182 was a relatively unknown band, and not many reviews were written about it. After its meteoric rise, many top rock magazines were regretting their decision to write off blink-182. </p>
